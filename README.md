# JavaScript-Advanced-Exercises
Some of the problems I solved in my JavaScript Advanced course


In the “JS Advanced” course I developed an in-depth knowledge of the JavaScript language. Now I am quite comfortable with the basics of syntax, working with arrays, matrices, objects, classes and writing functions in JS. I also feel confindent with more complex concepts such as function context, explicit binding, event loops. This course has develop my algorithmic thinking and has taught me to work with the DOM tree, do manipulations on it, and work with "events". I can now implement concepts such as inheritance, object composition, and prototype chains.

After having completed a series of general introductory Python courses over the months of February, March, and April 2021, I started my official education with SoftUni by entering their ‘Programming Basics with Python’ course in the summer of the same year. I then continued to their ‘Programming Fundamentals with Python’ course, which started in September and finished in December of 2021. After that I completed their ‘Python Advanced’ course and went on to finish their “Python OOP” course (Jan - April 2022). Now I have also completed the "JS Advanced" course which started in mid-May 2022 and finished in late June.

The "JS Advanced" course lasted over a month with 3-hour-long classes four times a week and graded homework assignments. Every second class would be an “exercise class” with more sophisticated problems for homework, while every first class was a “lab class” where we got introduced to new concepts through easier problems. Some of the problems I solved you can find above.
